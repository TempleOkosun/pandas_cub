# Build a data Analysis Library from Scratch

This repository is a project based learning with Ted Petrou to utilize my Python programming skills and develop a library 
for data analysis similar to pandas. The library will be used for my small and quick data analysis and wrangling needs. 
I will continually include functionalities that addresses challenges i encounter in my data projects. 

## Objectives

Most data scientists who use Python rely on pandas. pandas_cub implements many of the common and useful pandas methods:

* Have a DataFrame class with data stored in numpy arrays
* Select subsets of data with the brackets operator
* Use special methods defined in the Python data model
* Have a nicely formatted display of the DataFrame in the notebook
* Implement aggregation methods - sum, min, max, mean, median, etc...
* Implement non-aggregation methods such as isna, unique, rename, drop
* Group by one or two columns
* Have methods specific to string columns
* Read in data from a comma-separated value file

## Test-Driven Development with pytest

The completion of each part of this project is predicated upon passing the
tests written in the `test_dataframe.py` module inside the `tests` folder.


## To be Done
* Visualizing data by making calls to matplotlib library.
